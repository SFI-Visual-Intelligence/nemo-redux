# Project Nemo â€” Redux

Detecting, classifying, and segmenting microscopic foraminifera.

## Warning: there be dragons

This repository contains the majority of experiments I ran towards the end of my PhD journey.
Some parts of the code haven't been touched or tested in a few months, and might have broken;
specifically, the classification experiments.

I plan to revisit this codebase once I've defended by PhD and transition back to a normal life.
If you encounter any problems, please submit an issue or a pull request.
